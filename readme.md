This project is basically a learning exercise to help me understand the following technologies:

1. Azure Websites
2. ASP MVC v5
3. ASP Web API v2
4. [nPoco](https://github.com/schotime/NPoco)  - Lightweight Object Relationship Management
5. [Autofac](http://autofac.org/)  - Dependency Injection


In conjunction with this readme there will be some blog posts describing my progress.
